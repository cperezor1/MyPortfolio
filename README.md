This repository contains the work I have done since I started to work with data as a tool to address complex problems and find the best ways to solve them. 

**Classification - Classification Trees and Logistic Regression**

The German Credit data is a modified dataset taken from the University of California, Irvine and its Machine Learning repository.  It contains 1.000 records with information ergarding the attributes of its clients and how are they are classifed as good or bad credit. 

In this case, I used this dataset to apply Machine learning to create a model that allows the bank to classify new clients as good or bad credit. From the business point of view, classify the clients and use a monetary value associated with the good use of credit, can help them to reduce losses derived of giving credits to individuals that can not afford them or that have bad repayment reputation.

Two models (Logit regression) and Decision trees were tested and their accuracy analyzed to decide which one will fit better the prediction of new clients and reduce the current losses the bank had before the implementation of a classification method.


The findings during data exploration were the lack of FEMALES on the gender fields, the suggested uses for the given credit are very basic.
The chosen model was Classification trees that showed a general lower accuracy but during deployment showed less false-positives (bad clients classified as good clients) and that feature would make a huge difference in monetary terms to the bank results.
