This repository contains the work I have done since I started to work with data as a tool to address complex problems and find the best ways to solve them. 

## **Classification - Classification Trees and Logistic Regression**

The German Credit data is a modified dataset taken from the University of California, Irvine and its Machine Learning repository.  It contains 1.000 records with information ergarding the attributes of its clients and how are they are classifed as good or bad credit. 

In this case, I used this dataset to apply Machine learning to create a model that allows the bank to classify new clients as good or bad credit. From the business point of view, classify the clients and use a monetary value associated with the good use of credit, can help them to reduce losses derived of giving credits to individuals that can not afford them or that have bad repayment reputation.

Two models (Logit regression) and Decision trees were tested and their accuracy analyzed to decide which one will fit better the prediction of new clients and reduce the current losses the bank had before the implementation of a classification method.


The findings during data exploration were the lack of FEMALES on the gender fields, the suggested uses for the given credit are very basic.
The chosen model was Classification trees that showed a general lower accuracy but during deployment showed less false-positives (bad clients classified as good clients) and that feature would make a huge difference in monetary terms to the bank results.

## **Prediction - Linear Regression**

As part of our coursework, students should complete an actual business project. In my case, I was part of a Capstone project that involved acting as a consultant for a small local business in the greater Toronto area (GTA) and assessing their data management capabilities and uses. 
The process was conducted entirely as a consulting project. The consultants had to understand the business model, the data the owners were collecting, how they used it, and with what purpose and to provide feedback to improve the insights generated by it. 
After the initial meetings, the consensus was that to ensure an adequate data environment could be created, some fundamental business problems, such as client definition, target audience, and value proposition, should be answered first. 

Right after the diagnosis, suggestions presented to the owner aimed to improve the data collection process, including re-writing the questionnaire, using dropdown menus to reduce typing errors, and re-orientating medical history questions to obtain more actionable information). 
Suggestions regarding risk management (liabilities waivers) were also inlcuded. 

Initially, the project was designed to help the owner leverage her data to obtain better marketing results. Still, after the diagnosis, we did two things: an analytical characterization of her clients and a predictive model to target individuals with certain traits that could make them highly-valuable customers.
